    <p>There has probably never been a better time to be a UX professional. Agile Development and Lean Start Up movement have finally made everyone understand what the UX people have been saying always.

        <h2>Sea Calm</h2>
            <p>Sea Calm is a trainer for the box breathing. Box breathing is a good way to achieve calm ready state while under stress. The more you practice the better you can use when you need it</p>

    <h1>Prototyping</h1>
    <p>I prefer making prototypes with Invision using either Sketch or Omingraffle for the design</p>

    <h1>Articles - TBD</h1>
    <p>In my opinion the best use for blog writing and other social media is to learn. Learn about languages, learn about tech, learn about history and learn about whatever interests me.
    When I write about kanjis or robots or any other thing I am interested in I learn a lot about it. I learn to explain what the thing is really about and what it means.</p>
